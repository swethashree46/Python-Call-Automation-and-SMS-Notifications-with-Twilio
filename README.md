**Call Automation System using Twilio API** 

This Python-based project demonstrates how to automate phone calls and SMS notifications using the **Twilio API**. The system makes automated calls with dynamic messages and sends SMS notifications to users in real-time.

## Features
- Automated real-time calls using Twilio API.
- SMS notifications with custom messages.
- Real-time status updates for calls and messages.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core programming language.
- **Twilio API**: For handling automated calls and SMS.
- **Flask (optional)**: Can be used to extend the system with a web interface for scheduling calls or messages.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/auto-call-sms.git
   cd auto-call-sms
   ```

2. **Install required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up Twilio**:
   - Create a Twilio account at [Twilio.com](https://www.twilio.com/).
   - Get your **Account SID** and **Auth Token** from the Twilio console.
   - Update the `call_sms_script.py` with your Twilio credentials:
     ```python
     account_sid = 'your_account_sid'
     auth_token = 'your_auth_token'
     ```

4. **Run the script**:
   Modify the `to_number`, `from_number`, and message content in `call_sms_script.py` as required. Then execute the script:
   ```bash
   python call_sms_script.py
   ```

## Example Usage

This Python script allows you to automate the following actions:
- **Place automated calls**: You can customize the message that will be spoken during the call.
- **Send SMS notifications**: You can send real-time messages to any number.
